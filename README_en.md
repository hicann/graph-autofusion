## 🔥Latest News

- [2026/04] Autofuse component is open sourced!
  The Autofuse automatic fusion function is provided on Ascend chips. It can automatically fuse adjacent operators into one, eliminating the time consumption of input and output transfer, reducing the number of operators, and optimizing the total operator execution time.
- [2025/10] Graph-autofusion project is open sourced!
  SuperKernel fusion function is provided on Ascend chips. It can reduce task scheduling waiting time and scheduling overhead, optimizing operator execution overhead.

## 🚀Overview

Graph-autofusion is a lightweight, decoupled component collection for Ascend chips. It aims to accelerate model execution through various fusion-related technologies. Currently, the SuperKernel component and Autofuse component are open sourced, and more fusion-related modules will be continuously released in the future.

Component features:

- **Focus on fusion acceleration technology**: Efficient fusion and acceleration are implemented based on codegen JIT compilation mechanism.
- **Modular and decoupled**: Components are independent and can be selected as needed. The underlying dependencies are minimal, relying only on AscendC and the runtime environment.

## ⚡️Quick Start

- To experience the complete build, test, and sample running process of Graph-autofusion, see [Build Verification](docs/en/build.md).
- To understand the principle and usage of the SuperKernel component, see [SuperKernel Introduction](super_kernel/README.md).
- To understand the principle and usage of the Autofuse component, see [Autofuse Introduction and Quick Start](autofuse/README.md).

## 📚 Documents

## 🌐 Ecosystem Integration

AutoFuse can be used as an automatic fusion backend for upper-layer graph compilers and deep learning frameworks, providing Ascend C fused operator generation capabilities for model compilation and execution. Currently the main integration paths are:

- **GE path**: As the automatic fusion backend for GE. Upper-layer frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can connect to and use AutoFuse through GE. For details, see the [GE project](https://gitcode.com/cann/ge).
- **Inductor path**: As the automatic fusion backend for PyTorch Inductor. For details, see the [TorchAir project](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/torchair).
