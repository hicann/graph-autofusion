# Environment Deployment

## 1. Environment Preparation

This project supports source code compilation. Before source code compilation, you need to ensure that CANN software (Toolkit development suite package and ops package (optional)) has been installed. If running samples, you also need to install NPU driver and firmware.

Please choose the software installation method according to the following description:

| Installation Method | Description | Usage Scenario |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| CANNLab | One-stop development platform, providing online directly runnable Ascend environment, no manual installation required.<br>Currently provides single-machine computing power, **installs the latest commercial release CANN package by default**. | Suitable for developers without Ascend devices. |
| Docker | Docker image is an efficient deployment method, one-click deployment of CANN package and essential dependencies.<br>Currently OS only supports Ubuntu operating system, **installs the latest commercial release CANN package by default**. | Suitable for developers with Ascend devices who need to quickly set up the environment. |
| Manual Installation | Manual installation of CANN package and basic dependencies, high flexibility. | Suitable for developers with Ascend devices who want to experience manual CANN package installation or experience the latest master branch capabilities. |

### Method 1: CANNLab

For developers without Ascend devices, you can directly use CANNLab cloud development environment, which is a "**one-stop development platform**". This platform provides online directly runnable Ascend environment for you, with essential driver firmware, software packages and dependencies already installed, no manual installation required.

> [!NOTE]NOTE
> The environment installs the latest commercial release CANN package by default. Please note the software compatibility when downloading source code. To experience master version capabilities or develop based on master version, please refer to [**Method 3 - Scenario 1**](#method-3-manual-package-installation) to install the latest CANN package dependencies.<br>For more introduction about the development platform, please refer to [CANNLab Guide](https://gitcode.com/org/cann/discussions/54).

1. Enter the open source project and click the "`CANNLab`" button, log in with a certified Huawei Cloud account. If not registered or certified, please follow the page prompts to register and certify.

2. Create NPU environment and configure specifications according to page prompts. After starting the cloud development environment, click "`Connect > WebIDE`" to enter the one-stop development platform.

   Currently, the open source project resource directory depends on how the environment was created:
   - If created from the CANN community repository, resources are located in `/mnt/workspace/gitCode/cann`.
   - If created from a personally forked CANN repository, resources are located in `/mnt/workspace/gitCode/{forked_repository}`.

### Method 2: Docker Deployment

For developers who do not depend on Ascend devices, if you want to quickly set up a compilation build environment, use Docker image deployment.

> [!NOTE]NOTE
>Image files are large. Downloading requires some time. Please wait patiently. For docker command option descriptions, query through `docker --help`.

1.**Install Driver and Firmware (Runtime Dependency)**

For Ascend driver and firmware download and installation operations on the host machine, refer to the "Prepare Software Packages" and "Install NPU Driver and Firmware" chapters in the "[CANN Software Installation Guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard)".

2.**Download Image**

- Step 1: Log in to the host machine as root user. Ensure Docker engine (version 1.11.2 or above) is installed on the host machine.
- Step 2: Pull the pre-integrated CANN software package and development-required dependencies image from the [Ascend Image Repository](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/ascendhub/detail/17da20d1c2b6493cb38765adeba85884). Use the following command. Select based on actual architecture (using Atlas A2 series products as example, compilation-only scenarios do not need attention):

    ```bash
    # Example: Pull ARM architecture CANN development image
    docker pull --platform=arm64 swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.0-beta.1-910-ubuntu22.04-py3.11
    # Example: Pull X86 architecture CANN development image
    docker pull --platform=amd64 swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.0-beta.1-910-ubuntu22.04-py3.11
    ```

3.**Run Docker**
Select different startup methods based on use case:

- **Scenario 1: Compilation Build Only (No Sample Execution Required)**

  If you only need code compilation build without NPU device access, use the following simplified command:

  ```bash
  docker run --name cann_container -it -u root --privileged=true -v /home/gaf/:/home/gaf swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.0-beta.1-910-ubuntu22.04-py3.11 bash
  ```

- **Scenario 2: Sample Execution Required (NPU Device Access Required)**

  If you need to run samples or tests, the container needs to access the host machine's NPU devices. Using Atlas A2 series products as example:

  ```bash
  docker run --name cann_container \
    --device /dev/davinci0 \
    --device /dev/davinci_manager \
    --device /dev/devmm_svm \
    --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
    -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
    -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
    -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
    -it -u root --privileged=true \
    swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.0-beta.1-910-ubuntu22.04-py3.11 bash
  ```

  > [!NOTE]NOTE
  > - Scenario 1 applies to compilation-only scenarios for graph-autofusion. No NPU device support required.
  > - Scenario 2 applies to scenarios requiring sample execution or NPU-related testing. Host machine requires NPU driver and firmware installed.
  > - If using other chip models (such as Ascend950PR or Atlas A3 series products), adjust device names in the `--device` parameter accordingly.

4.**Initialize Environment**
After entering the container, execute the following command to initialize the environment:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.gitcode.com/cann/graph-autofusion/raw/master/scripts/init_env.sh | bash
  ```

> [!NOTE]NOTE
>
> - CANN package and operator package installation occurs by default.
> - For other chip models, use the `--chip-type` parameter to specify the corresponding model (such as `950` or `A3`). For optional parameters, refer to [init_env.sh](../../scripts/init_env.sh)

### Method 3: Manual Package Installation

1. **Install Driver and Firmware (Optional, Only Required for Running [Samples](../../autofuse/examples/pytorch/README_en.md))**

    For driver and firmware download and installation operations, refer to the "Prepare Software Packages" and "Install NPU Driver and Firmware" chapters in the "[CANN Software Installation Guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard)". Driver and firmware are dependencies for running samples. If you only compile the environment, you do not need to install them.

2. **Install CANN Package**

   **Scenario 1: Experience master version capabilities or develop based on master version**

     Click the [download link](https://ascend.devcloud.huaweicloud.com/artifactory/cann-run-mirror/software/master) to get the latest time version. Download the corresponding package based on product model and environment architecture. Use the following installation command. For more guidance, refer to [CANN Software Installation Guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard).

     1. Install CANN Toolkit development kit package.

        ```bash
        # Ensure the installation package has execute permission
        chmod +x Ascend-cann-toolkit_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run
        # Installation command
        ./Ascend-cann-toolkit_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run --install --install-path=${install_path}
        ```

        - `${cann_version}`: Indicates CANN package version number.
        - `${arch}`: Indicates CPU architecture, for example, `aarch64` or `x86_64`.
        - `${install_path}`: Indicates the specified installation path. Must match the Toolkit package installation path. Root user default installation path is `/usr/local/Ascend` directory.

     2. Install CANN ops operator package.

        ```bash
        # Ensure the installation package has execute permission
        chmod +x Ascend-cann-${soc_name}-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run
        # Installation command
        ./Ascend-cann-${soc_name}-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run --install --install-path=${install_path}
        ```

        `${soc_name}` indicates the NPU model name.

   **Scenario 2: Experience released version capabilities or develop based on released version**

    If you want to experience **official released CANN package** capabilities, visit the [CANN Official Download Center](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/download). Select the corresponding version CANN software package (only supports CANN 8.5.0 and later versions) for installation.
